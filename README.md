# marathon-scrapers

This repository contains the various scrapers needed to populate the [Marathon Results Dataset](https://github.com/AndrewMillerOnline/marathon-results).  Each race essentially needed its own custom scraper.  Some were simple matters of parsing HTML while others required Selenium interaction to populate javascript/JSON results.  The scrapers are stored in this repository for the sake of posterity and to facilitate gathering of future race results.
